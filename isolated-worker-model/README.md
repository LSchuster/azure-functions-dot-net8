# Azure Functions C# for .NET 8 and Isolated Worker Model

The **Azure Functions Isolated Worker Model** is a powerful way to build serverless applications using .NET 8. This model decouples the execution of your Azure Functions from the Azure Functions runtime, providing greater flexibility, dependency injection, and middleware support, making it ideal for modern .NET developers.

This guide will help you set up, run, and debug Azure Functions using .NET 8 with the isolated worker model.

## Key Features of the Isolated Worker Model

- **Custom Hosting:** Full control over the hosting environment to integrate with existing apps or libraries.
- **Dependency Injection:** Native support for .NET dependency injection patterns.
- **Middleware Support:** Add middleware for custom request/response processing pipelines.
- **.NET Version Flexibility:** Independent updates of the .NET runtime from the Azure Functions runtime.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and environments are installed before starting:

- **.NET 8 SDK**: Download from the [official .NET site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
- **Azure Functions Core Tools**: Install the tools by following the [official instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?pivots=programming-language-csharp#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).
- **For Visual Studio Users**:
  - Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
  - During installation, select the **Azure development** workload.
- **For Visual Studio Code Users**:
  - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - Add the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for seamless development and debugging.

## Running Your Azure Functions Locally

To test your Azure Functions locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project's root directory (e.g., `isolated-worker-model` folder).
3. Start the Azure Functions host using the following command:

    ```shell
    func start
    ```

   This will launch the Azure Functions runtime, enabling you to test your functions locally.

With this setup, you're ready to build, debug, and deploy robust serverless applications using the latest features of .NET 8 and the isolated worker model.
